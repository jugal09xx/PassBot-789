# PassBot-789 - Secure Password Manager

PassBot-789 is a secure password manager designed for the CMPT-789 Applied Cryptography course project, taking inspiration from [KeePassXC](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/). It offers a reliable solution for managing passwords securely. The tool stores encrypted data in (.csv) database files. The database can be accessed using a master password. The application employs AES-256 encryption in CBC mode, using a 32-byte key generated by hashing the master password with SHA-256. This key is then employed for data encryption, with a randomly generated Initialization Vector (IV) for each new database file. Encrypted data is stored in a CSV file within the project directory, and access to this database relies on the user remembering their master password.

## Features
- **Create New Database**: Create a new password database with a master password.
- **Open Existing Database**: Access an existing password database by providing the master password.
- **View Entries**: Display a list of stored credentials, with an option to copy passwords to the clipboard.
- **Add New Entry**: Introduce a new entry with a title, username, and a user-defined or randomly generated password.
- **Delete Entry**: Remove a stored entry from the database.
- **Generate Random Password**: Optionally create a random password with default settings (16 characters, including uppercase, lowercase alphabet, and special characters).
- **Encryption**: Implements AES-256 encryption in CBC mode, with a SHA-256 hashed master password and a randomly generated Initialization Vector (IV) for each new database file.
